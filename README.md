# StackAndBlind

These scripts can be used to take Z-stack images, apply a maximum projection and then randomly rename the image files for blinding purposes.
Renamed files will be stored in an output folder, and a CSV file will also be created to allow the new image numbers to be matched to the original file names once subjective measurements have been completed.

The script ending in _mvd2s is specifically for use with mvd2 files containing multiple Z stacks.
